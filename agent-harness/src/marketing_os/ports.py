"""Ports — the interfaces the domain and orchestration depend on.

The model and tool ports are LangChain's own ``BaseChatModel`` and ``BaseTool``,
so they are not re-declared here. This module defines the one remaining port that
benefits from an explicit contract: the QA :class:`Reviewer`, which the graph
depends on and which tests substitute with a scripted fake.
